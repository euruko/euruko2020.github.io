¹ Higher sponsorship levels get premium placement for their exhibit space. Location assignments will be on a first-come, first-served basis, and will be made solely at the discretion of the Euruko 2020 organisers. All exhibit space furnishing and signage (aside from basic tables) must be provided by the sponsor. Displays or monitors may be provided by the event venue (if available), but the costs for these must be paid by the sponsor.<br>

² Roll-ups to be supplied by the sponsor

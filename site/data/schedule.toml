Many projects have automated accessibility checkers, and that is a good start. However, they don't catch most of the failures on accessibility. There are some fairly simple checks to ensure a better experience for your users, and from this talk, you'll learn how to do them and, most importantly, why they are essential to do.

description = """
Ruby's current memory layout does not optimize for cache performance, and this has implications: object data like string and array contents are often not stored close to the objects that use them, causing poor data locality, reducing the efficiency of CPU caches, and making it more complex for the garbage collector to manage these objects. Additionally, objects can also contain pointers to data that then point back into the Ruby heap, slowing down object access due to pointer indirection.

Join us as we explore how the variable width allocation project will change the garbage collector heap to replace the system's malloc heap, giving us finer control of the memory layout to optimize for performance.

Integrated development environment (IDE) is one of the most frequently used tools for programming. It's a kind of text editor where you type and read the code, but it does more for you.

I have been working for IDE development to support Ruby programming with a static type checker. It is based on the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and implemented in Ruby.

I want to share my experience. What is the protocol? How can the LSP features be implemented? You will get to know the under-the-hood of IDEs, and the tools will become more familiar to you.

You will attract and relate to customers how look like you. They will understand your messaging and you will understand their needs. If you don't represent the right dimensions of diversity, you are leaving an amazing experience behind.

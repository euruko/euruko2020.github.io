        <p>
          In the spring we had decided to move the conference to 2021 as it
          became increasingly clear that it would be impossible to hold it while
          the COVID-19 crisis was growing worse in Europe and around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the good news about vaccines, we don't currently think that it
          will be realistically possible to hold a large, in-person event in May
          of 2021. Because of this, we've decided to move the Euruko 2021
          conference online.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will be offering refunds for ticket holders who don't wish to
          participate in an online-only event. For those who keep their tickets,
          we'll be offering various perks, including at least the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A goodie bag mailed to them where-ever they are in the world</li>
          <li>Access to interactive conference features</li>
          <li>Access to a Euruko Discord server</li>
          <li>Access to a private Euruko Minecraft server</li>
          <li>A 20% discount to the 2022 conference</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We're also planning on increasing access to the conference by offering
          a free stream of the conference to anyone in the world through YouTube
          or Twitch, without the interactive features that paying ticket holders
          will receive.
        </p>

        <h2>CFP</h2>

        <p>
          The call for propasals will open during February. Get your talks
          ready!
        </p>

        <h2>Volunteers</h2>

        <p>
          We're still going to be looking for some volunteers to be moderators
          and mentors for first time conference goers. The applications for this
          will open at the same time as the CFP.
        </p>

        <h2>Diversity tickets</h2>

        <p>
          We'll still be offering diversity tickets to members of
          underrepresented groups. These tickets will include full access to the
          conference. We still need to work out the process for these, but we're
          aiming to start accepting applications during February.
        </p>

        <h2>2022</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Helsinki, baby!</strong> Since the Euruko Helsinki hasn't
          happened, we're still aiming to have an in-person confernce in
          Helsinki in 2022.

        <p>
          In the spring we had decided to move the conference to 2021 as it
          became increasingly clear that it would be impossible to hold it while
          the COVID-19 crisis was growing worse in Europe and around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the good news about vaccines, we don't currently think that it
          will be realistically possible to hold a large, in-person event in May
          of 2021. Because of this, we've decided to move the Euruko 2021
          conference online.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ticket-holders will get various perks, including at least the
          following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A goodie bag mailed to them where-ever they are in the world</li>
          <li>Access to interactive conference features</li>
          <li>Access to a Euruko Discord server</li>
          <li>Access to a private Euruko Minecraft server</li>
          <li>A 20% discount to the 2022 conference</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We're also planning on increasing access to the conference by offering
          a free stream of the conference to anyone in the world through YouTube
          or Twitch, without the interactive features that paying ticket holders
          will receive.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you would rather get a refund for your ticket, please fill out the
          <a href="https://forms.gle/BW8KGqBEkNxKMtdE7">refund request form</a>
          by the end of March. Please note that refunds are processed manually
          so it may take a few days for you to receive a reply.
        </p>

        <p>
          Access to the online features will become available closer to the
          event dates and goodie bags will ship in May.
        </p>

        <h2>CFP</h2>

        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://sessionize.com/euruko-2021/">call for proposals</a>
          is now open for both full sessions and lightning talks. It will remain
          open until April 18th.
        </p>

        <p>
          All volunteers will get full access to the conference, including
          having the goodie bag shipped to them. If you already have a ticket to
          the conference, we will refund you (or you can re-assign the ticket to
          a friend or colleague).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you need any equipment to deliver your talk (e.g. a webcam,
          lighting, or a microphone), we'll buy it for you (within reason).
          Lightning talks excluded.
        </p>

        <h2>Volunteers</h2>

        <p>
          We're
          <a href="https://forms.gle/ikenXXfKpTbogJWy6"
            >looking for volunteers</a
          >
          to act as moderators on the Euruko Discord server and the Euruko
          Minecraft server. We're also looking for guides/mentors for people for
          whom Euruko will be their first tech conference.
        </p>

        <p>
          All volunteers will get full access to the conference, including
          having the goodie bag shipped to them. If you already have a ticket to
          the conference, we will refund you (or you can re-assign the ticket to
          a friend or colleague).
        </p>

        <h2>Diversity tickets</h2>

        <p>
          We'll still be offering diversity tickets to members of
          under-represented groups. These tickets will include full access to
          the conference. We still need to work out the process for this, but
          we're aiming to start accepting applications by the end of March.
        </p>

        <h2>2022</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Helsinki, baby!</strong> Since Euruko Helsinki hasn't
          happened, we're still aiming to have an in-person conference in
          Helsinki in 2022.

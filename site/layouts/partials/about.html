        <h1 class="about__heading">What is Euruko?</h1>

        <p>Euruko is a Ruby conference organised annually, each year in a different European city chosen by the participants. In 2021 it will be organized online, and in 2022 in Helsinki, Finland.</p>

        <h1 class="about__heading">Euruko 2021 goes to SPACE</h1>

        <p>
          In the spring we had decided to move the conference to 2021 as it
          became increasingly clear that it would be impossible to hold it while
          the COVID-19 crisis was growing worse in Europe and around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the good news about vaccines, we don't currently think that it
          will be realistically possible to hold a large, in-person event in May
          of 2021. Because of this, we've decided to move the Euruko 2021
          conference online.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ticket-holders will get various perks, including the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A goodie bag mailed to them where-ever they are in the world</li>
          <li>Access to interactive conference features</li>
          <li>Access to a Euruko Discord server</li>
          <li>Access to a private Euruko Minecraft server</li>
          <li>A 20% discount to the 2022 conference</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We're also planning on increasing access to the conference by offering
          a free stream of the conference to anyone in the world through YouTube
          or Twitch, without the interactive features that paying ticket holders
          will receive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Access to the online features will become available closer to the
          event dates and goodie bags will ship in May.
        </p>

        <h2>2022</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Helsinki, baby!</strong> Since Euruko Helsinki hasn't
          happened, we're still aiming to have an in-person conference in
          Helsinki in 2022.

SUMMARY:Don't Develop Just for Yourself - A Developer's Checklist to Accessibility (Eeva-Jonna Panula)

DESCRIPTION:Developer, are you (unconsciously) developing sites for users just like yourself? It often means a sighted mouse user with good fine motor skills and who is proficient with computers. But not every user is like that.\n\nMany projects have automated accessibility checkers, and that is a good start. However, they don't catch most of the failures on accessibility. There are some fairly simple checks to ensure a better experience for your users, and from this talk, you'll learn how to do them and, most importantly, why they are essential to do.\n

LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:What are your options when dealing with PDFs in Ruby? Are you creating PDFs? Then you are likely using wkhtmltopdf or Prawn.\n\nWhat if you need to manipulate PDF files? Are you resorting to calling command line tools like pdftk? Or chaining multiple libraries/CLI tools together?\n\nHave you tried HexaPDF? It is a relatively new PDF library for Ruby which unites all PDF manipulation and creation facilities under one pure-Ruby roof. It is fast with low memory usage and a very Ruby-esque API interface.\n\nThe lightning talk will give a short introduction into the available libraries and then focus on the current state of HexaPDF and what it brings to the table.\n

We’ve all been there; someone else changes their API in a way you weren’t expecting, and now you have a live-ops incident you need to fix urgently to get your software working again. Of course, many of us are on the other side too: we build APIs that other people’s software relies on.

You deployed the app to production, but after a while, you realized, that responses are not super fast. How to find out what makes your GraphQL endpoint slow?\n\nWe’ll discuss how queries are executed and what makes processing slower. After that, we’ll learn how to measure performance in the GraphQL era and determine the part we should improve. Finally, we’ll discuss possible solutions and some advanced technics to keep your GraphQL app fast!\n

SUMMARY:Optimizing Ruby's memory layout (Peter Zhu & Matthew Valentine-House)
UID:1622208600@euruko2021.org
SEQUENCE:1019171
STATUS:CONFIRMED
DTSTAMP:20210528T181107Z
DTSTART:20210528T133000Z
DTEND:20210528T141500Z
LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Ruby's current memory layout does not optimize for cache performance, and this has implications: object data like string and array contents are often not stored close to the objects that use them, causing poor data locality, reducing the efficiency of CPU caches, and making it more complex for the garbage collector to manage these objects. Additionally, objects can also contain pointers to data that then point back into the Ruby heap, slowing down object access due to pointer indirection.\n\nJoin us as we explore how the variable width allocation project will change the garbage collector heap to replace the system's malloc heap, giving us finer control of the memory layout to optimize for performance.\n

I will survey Ruby lovers of all levels to see what has been holding their attention during this difficult year.\n\nI will also share my own experience with staying busy, including my adventure building an "On Air" alert system for Zoom in my home office space using Ruby.\n

LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Integrated development environment (IDE) is one of the most frequently used tools for programming. It's a kind of text editor where you type and read the code, but it does more for you. On-the-fly error reporting, completion, go-to-definition, and more. These features help you writing and reading the code and make the tools more valuable than simple text editors.\n\nI have been working for IDE development to support Ruby programming with a static type checker. It is based on the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and implemented in Ruby.\n\nI want to share my experience. What is the protocol? How can the LSP features be implemented? You will get to know the under-the-hood of IDEs, and the tools will become more familiar to you.\n

LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Daily, we are pushing the boundaries of how fast we can deliver software. Constantly running on a knife’s edge between great success and horrible failure.\n\nDelivering something new, better, faster than our competition can mean incredible payoff and we are constantly being asked to cut costs and deliver more, faster, cheaper. But then suddenly, you fall off the other side of the edge and wake up to 189 dead in a plane crash or having to take down and redesign your entire banking service because the architecture didn’t hold up to the load. It probably wasn’t your decision to push that to production but one can imagine that a long chain of people have to have made a number of small (or huge) decisions that led up to that result.\n

LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Ruby and Rails applications are notoriously difficult to package in the native formats (.deb, .rpm) used by the main Linux distributions.\n\nAlthough Docker has allowed to ship applications almost anywhere, native packages remain relevant in constrained environments (banks, etc.), or when distributing an app or CLI to end users that may not have or want to use Docker.\n\nIn this presentation you’ll learn how to package a Rails application for the main Linux distributions available. You’ll also learn how to host the resulting packages, and apply the same recipe to package a Ruby CLI that can be shipped to users.\n

Those differences can include demographic differences (like age, race, sex, ethnicity), personality (extrovert, introvert, and differing Myers-Briggs types) and functional (as in skill sets, like engineering, design, copywriting, and marketing).\n\nHow does team diversity impact your customers' experience from the moment they learn about you through their journey with you?\nYou will attract and relate to customers how look like you. They will understand your messaging and you will understand their needs. If you don't represent the right dimensions of diversity, you are leaving an amazing experience behind.\n
